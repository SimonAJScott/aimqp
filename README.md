AI-Driven Gameplay Footage Generation
Worcester Polytechnic Institute Major Qualifying Project

Our project is a data-driven system that simulates key press combinations and their associated durations, adjusting probabilities based on success or failure. It supports random data generation, saving/loading data for persistence, and real-time updates based on user input. The scope of our project revolves around mario, but can be altered to work with any platformer.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

1. Clone the repository
git clone <https://github.com/SimonAJScott/aimqp.git>

2. Set up the Python environment
Create a virtual environment:
py -m venv .venv
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies
Install the required Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Running the Project
Once set up, you can start interacting with the classes that manage the key press data (Data, LevelMemory, PercentData) for generating random data, saving/loading files, and updating probabilities based on user actions.
